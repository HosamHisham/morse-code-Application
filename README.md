Proper use of application for encryption:
1.	Open the application through visual studio
2.	Install python extensions
3.	Run the application without debugging
4.	enter e for encryption and press enter
5.	Enter your message and press enter
6.	The application will output the encoded message
In the case of encrypting the application will only be able to encrypt the English language and English numbers. The use of any other language will cause the application to stop functioning. The use of uppercase and lowercase letters is unnecessary as the application treats all letters as the form of uppercase. Ensure that there are no spacing between your letters while entering the message otherwise it will be processed as a new sentence with the spacing between each sentence is only one the use of multiple spacing could result in the the wrong output or a possible crash in the application.


proper use of application for decryption:
1.	Open the application through visual studio
2.	Install python extension
3.	Run the application without debugging
4.	enter d for decryption and press enter
5.	Enter your cipher and press enter
6.	Application will print the decoded message
The application uses international morse code by its default settings so ensure that the cipher is in international morse code and not another type of encryption. In the case where the cipher uses another variant of morse code the morse code could be changed in the dictionary of the application to match your cipher and function properly. Ensure that the morse code entered is correct with spaces between each decrypted sentence and not a special character as the application uses spaces to be able to define between letters and sentences and not the use of special character otherwise it will try and decode and could cause the application to crash or output the wrong message.
